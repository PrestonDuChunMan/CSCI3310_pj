# Basketball App Server
This server is mainly used for event hosting for the court finder features.  
The purpose of it is to simply store the events in a database, and return them as requested. DO NOT make it do anymore computations.

## Running
You will need Node.js installed on your computer.

```bash
cd to/this/directory # if you haven't
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```
